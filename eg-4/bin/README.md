# Java Game Quit Example

This project demonstrates a Java program that uses the `Scanner` class to read user input in a simple game where pressing 'Q' or 'q' quits the game, and any other input continues the game.

## Getting Started

Create a file named `Main.java` and paste the following code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("You are playing a game. Press Q or q to quit.");

        String response = scanner.next();

        if (!response.equals("q") && !response.equals("Q")) {
            System.out.println("You are still playing the game. Peww Peww!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You have quit the game!");
        }

        scanner.close();  // Correctly closing the scanner
    }
}
```

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`. Compile the program using the following command:

```sh
javac Main.java
```

Run the program with the following command:

```sh
java Main
```

## Notes

The `Scanner` class is used to read user input. The program checks if the input is 'Q' or 'q' to determine if the user wants to quit the game. Any other input means the user continues playing. The `Scanner` object is properly closed at the end of the program to avoid resource leaks.
