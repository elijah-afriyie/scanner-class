# Java Swing Input and Message Example

This project demonstrates a simple Java program using Swing's `JOptionPane` to interact with the user through dialog boxes. The program prompts the user to enter their name and age, then displays the provided information in message dialogs.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (preferably JDK 21 or higher).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to compile and run the Java program:

### 1. Create the Java Source File

Create a file named `Main.java` and paste the following code:

```java
import javax.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prompt the user to enter their name
        String name = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is your name?");

        // Display a message with the user's name
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello, " + name + "!");

        // Prompt the user to enter their age
        int age = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog("How old are you?"));

        // Display a message with the user's age
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "You are " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```
````

### 2. Compile the Program

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`. Compile the program using the following command:

```sh
javac Main.java
```

### 3. Run the Program

After compiling, run the program with the following command:

```sh
java Main
```

### 4. Interact with the Program

- A dialog box will appear asking for your name. Enter your name and click "OK".
- Another dialog box will appear greeting you with your name. Click "OK".
- A dialog box will appear asking for your age. Enter your age and click "OK".
- Finally, a dialog box will appear displaying your age. Click "OK" to close the program.

## How It Works

- `JOptionPane.showInputDialog` displays a dialog box that prompts the user for input. It returns the input as a `String`.
- `JOptionPane.showMessageDialog` displays a dialog box with a message.
- `Integer.parseInt` converts the input string to an integer.

## Notes

- Ensure that your environment is correctly set up for running Java applications.
- If any exceptions are encountered (such as `NumberFormatException` when entering the age), ensure that valid inputs are provided.
